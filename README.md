On October 21, 2024, the Ontario Government passed Bill 212 - "Saving You Time Act". This bill proposes to remove the 3 major bikes lanes that connect downtown Toronto at an estimated cost of $48,000,000. This legislation highly affects the safety of those who either, cannot afford a car, are not able to use a car, or simply rather not drive.
